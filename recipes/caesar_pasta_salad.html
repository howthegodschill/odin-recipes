      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 small)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

      <li>1 1/2 cups homemade or store-bought croutons</li>
      <li>1/2 cup homemade or store-bought creamy Caesar dressing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large saucepan of heavily salted water to a boil.
        Add 8 ounces dried rotini pasta and cook according to package
        directions until al dente, 9 to 11 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the chicken.</li>

      <li>Pat 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts dry with paper towels
        and cut into 1-inch cubes. Season all over with 1/2 teaspoon kosher
        salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>

      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger skillet over
        medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken in a single layer
        and cook, flipping occasionally, until cooked through and browned all
        over, 6 to 8 minutes total. Remove the skillet from the heat.</li>

      <li>When the pasta is ready, drain and rinse with cold water to cool.
        Drain well.</li>

      <li>Prepare the following, adding each to the same large bowl as you
        complete it: Core and chop 1 small heart romaine lettuce into
        bite-sized pieces (about 3 cups). Shave 1 ounce Parmesan cheese with
        a vegetable peeler into shards (about 1/2 cup).</li>

      <li>Add the pasta, chicken, 1 pint grape tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups croutons,
        and 1/2 cup creamy Caesar dressing. Toss to coat. Garnish with more
        Parmesan cheese shards if desired.</li>
    </ol>
